### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kendall, I'm from Houston, Texas, but live in Worthing, UK on the South Coast of England.

I've just come out of being a managing director of a charity and vicar for 6 years and on the adventure of a lifetime learning how to code. 

I've currently been working through all of the front end side of freecodecamp and the odin project. I'm starting a 16 week, life changing bootcamp called School of Code to become job ready as a software engineer. 

Follow my journey here. You'll find my projects here starting 25 April 2022. Thanks for checking out my journey and have a great day.
